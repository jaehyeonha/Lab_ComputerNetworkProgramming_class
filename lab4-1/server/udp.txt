datagram         mode      of      packet-switched         computer         communication      in      the
environment      of      an    interconnected      set      of      computer      networks.         This
protocol      assumes      that   the   Internet      Protocol      (IP)      [1]   is   used   as   the underlying   protocol.
This   protocol      provides      a   procedure      for   application      programs      to   send
messages      to   other   programs      with   a   minimum      of   protocol   mechanism.      The
protocol      is   transaction   oriented,   and   delivery   and   duplicate   protection
are   not   guaranteed.      Applications   requiring   ordered   reliable delivery   of
streams   of   data   should   use   the   Transmission   Control   Protocol   (TCP)   [2].
